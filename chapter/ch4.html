    Chemistry Form 5: Chapter 4 - Exothermic and Endothermic Reaction
</p>
<p>
    Chemical energy is needed to transform a chemical substance into a new product through chemical reaction. Therefore, breaking or formation of chemical bond
    involves energy, which may be either absorbed or released from a chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
     To break the chemical bond, energy from surrounding is absorbed resulting decrease of temperature of surrounding.
</p>
<p>
     To form the chemical bond, energy from reaction is released to the surrounding resulting increase of temperature of surrounding.
